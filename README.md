# InSAR-Simulator
InSAR Data Simulator for generating synthetic InSAR noisy images with ground truth clean phase and cohrerence estimation. 

This Simulator is used for paper **"DeepInSAR: A Deep Learning Framework for SAR Interferometric Phase Restoration and Coherence Estimation"**. Please check out the branch ['DeepInSAR-v1'](https://github.com/Lucklyric/InSAR-Simulator/tree/DeepInSAR-v1) to get the same version which is used in paper's experiments.
